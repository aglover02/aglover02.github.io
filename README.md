This course will help me gain hands-on experience that will prepare me for future opportunities in web development.

Assignment 2
While completing these activities, I learned the basics of using JavaScript to calculate and display output on a webpage. I used variables to store values, such as hourly rates and age, and math to get results like weekly pay or age in months, days, etc. I also learned how to display text on the web page's content using document.write() to present results straight to users. 

Assignment 3
One of these programs lets users calculate the area of different shapes, including a rectangle, a triangle, and a circle, all based on the dimensions entered by the user. The other program calculates the area of a room in square yards based on dimensions entered by the user. The calculateRoomArea function computes the area of a room in square yards by first calculating the area in square feet and then converting it by dividing by 9 (since there are 9 square feet in 1 square yard). It prompts the user to enter the length and width of the room and then displays the area in square yards. The mainShapeAreas function does the area calculations for a rectangle, triangle, and circle. For each shape, the user is prompted for the dimensions, and the area is calculated and displayed.
