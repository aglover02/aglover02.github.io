While completing these activities, I learned the basics of using JavaScript to calculate and display output on a webpage. I used variables to store values, such as hourly rates and age, and math to get results like weekly pay or age in months, days, etc. I also learned how to display text on the web page's content using document.write() to present results straight to users.
