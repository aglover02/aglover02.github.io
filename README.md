Assignment1: 
I'm Autumn. I'm taking web200 to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and how to use it to create interactive websites. It will help me form the skills needed to develop dynamic web pages and manage data. Learning JavaScript is important for my career as it is widely used in the tech industry for building functional and engaging websites. This course will help me gain hands-on experience that will prepare me for future opportunities in web development.

Assignment 2: 
While completing these activities, I learned the basics of using JavaScript to calculate and display output on a webpage. I used variables to store values, such as hourly rates and age, and math to get results like weekly pay or age in months, days, etc. I also learned how to display text on the web page's content using document.write() to present results straight to users. 

Assignment 3: 
One of these programs lets users calculate the area of different shapes, including a rectangle, a triangle, and a circle, all based on the dimensions entered by the user. The other program calculates the area of a room in square yards based on dimensions entered by the user. The calculateRoomArea function computes the area of a room in square yards by first calculating the area in square feet and then converting it by dividing by 9 (since there are 9 square feet in 1 square yard). It prompts the user to enter the length and width of the room and then displays the area in square yards. The mainShapeAreas function does the area calculations for a rectangle, triangle, and circle. For each shape, the user is prompted for the dimensions, and the area is calculated and displayed. 

Assignment 4:
In this session, I used JavaScript to create interactive and user-friendly web applications using event listeners and DOM manipulation. I have a better understanding of how to structure my code logically, making it both efficient and easy to follow. This is valuable as I continue pursuing my Web Development AAS, where JavaScript is a critical skill for creating websites. I plan to apply this learning to build a portfolio of practical projects. This will support my educational goals and open up career opportunities as a web developer.

Assignment 5: While creating the sock size calculator and age converter programs, I learned how to use conditional statements such as if-else and switch to handle different scenarios efficiently. I also practiced using JavaScript event listeners to respond to user input and actions. By practicing separating the logic into distinct functions, I got a better understanding of modular code design for readability and reusability. This helped me better understand how to pass parameters and return results to avoid global variables, making the code more maintainable and easier to debug. 

Assignment 6: In this session, I learned how to use while loops to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. While loops are especially useful for tasks that need iteration without a predefined endpoint, as the loop continues until the condition is false. I learned about the importance of updating variables within the loop to avoid infinite loops that could crash a program. The examples showed how to implement while loops effectively, including scenarios like counting or processing items in a list, emphasizing their versatility in programming. 

Assignment 7: In this session, I used JavaScript to create some interactive programs by combining HTML elements, user input, and logic implemented with loops and functions. I used the Nilakantha series to calculate Pi using a for loop to handle iterative calculations. I gained more experience structuring code for readability and maintainability. I intend to apply these skills in my educational journey by building projects that show my growing proficiency in JavaScript. These projects will enhance my portfolio and prepare me for career opportunities in web development.

Assignment 8: In this session, I learned how to work with arrays in JavaScript, which is an important part of creating dynamic and interactive applications. I learned about how arrays can be used to store and manipulate multiple values, like the list of grades I created for the grade calculator. I also learned how to iterate over arrays using loops and methods like forEach(). Understanding arrays is essential for managing data effectively in programming, and I see it as an important tool for organizing and processing information in my future projects. As I continue to pursue my educational goals, I plan to apply this knowledge to handle more complex data structures and create more functional and responsive websites.

Assignment 9: Through this lesson, I learned how to effectively integrate HTML and JavaScript to create an interactive web page. I handled user input events with a date picker and dynamically displayed the date components using output elements. I practiced JavaScript best practices. This exercise also improved my understanding of handling dates accurately, particularly accounting for time zones with UTC methods.

Assignment 10: In this session, I got a better understanding of JavaScript objects and their role in structuring code efficiently. I learned how to define constructor functions to create objects with properties and methods, following the principles of encapsulation and reusability. By adding a method to the Book object prototype, I improved the programâ€™s design, making it more modular and scalable. Understanding JavaScript objects is important for building interactive web applications, and I plan to apply these concepts in my educational projects and future web development career, where object-oriented programming helps create maintainable and efficient code.

Assignment 11: This session has improved my understanding of JavaScript programming by demonstrating how to effectively use the Document Object Model (DOM) and interact with the Browser Object Model (BOM). Mapping node types to descriptive strings and converting live collections into static lists emphasized the importance of precision and best practices. I plan to apply this in my education and further studies in web development, as well as in my future career as a developer, where writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code is important for building web applications.

Assignment 12: In this session, I used JavaScript to create dynamic HTML content by responding to user interactions and updating the page without reloading it. I practiced handling events like button clicks and key presses, manipulating the DOM to add and remove elements, and displaying data generated in arrays. This experience helped me understand how dynamic web pages are built and how JavaScript brings interactivity to HTML. I plan to apply this knowledge in my web development coursework and future projects, building user-friendly websites that respond to input in real time. These skills are essential for my educational goals and future career as a developer.

Assignment 13: In this session, I learned about JavaScript form validation. Specifically, I became familiar with using HTML form attributes like pattern, required, and max length for data validation. This knowledge enhances the usability and reliability of web forms, an important skill for web development. I plan to apply these skills directly in my educational journey and future career opportunities by creating interactive websites that handle user inputs effectively, preparing me to build professional applications in web development roles.

Assignment 14: In this session, I  used JavaScript to send and retrieve data using AJAX and JSON, instead of relying on traditional form submissions. I practiced creating structured objects from a form input, sending them to a server using a POST request and handling the response. This experience improved my understanding of how client-side scripts can interact with APIs, which is essential for building dynamic web applications. I plan to apply this knowledge in future web development coursework and personal projects, and it will be especially valuable as I prepare for a career as a front-end or full-stack developer.
